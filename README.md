Lopez is a Discord bot written in Python (3) with the help of [`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)  
It manages a few irritating admin tasks for Discord administration automatically (such as self-assigned roles.)

## Requirements
* Python 3.5.3+
* `discord.py` v1.0.0 (latest is greatest, unless the latest is breaking)
* `asyncpg` and dependencies

## Installation
[Use this link to invite Lopez into your Discord server!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=436251140376494080&scope=bot&permissions=335899840)

(instructions on starting a dev instance coming soon:tm:)
