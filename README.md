Lopez is a Discord bot written in Python (3) with the help of [`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) It manages a few irritating admin tasks for Discord administration automatically (such as self-assigned roles.)

## Requirements
* Python 3.5.3+
* `discord.py` v1.0.0 (latest is greatest, unless the latest is breaking)
